LFG...It's Hackathon time!
Welcome to the 100xSchool Solana Hackathon – a chance to put your skills to the test and build something exciting on the Solana blockchain!

This hackathon is designed exclusively for 100xSchool students who want to explore the world of Web3 development, sharpen their problem-solving skills, and create real-world projects powered by Solana.

🛠️ What You’ll Build
Your goal is simple:

Build something on Solana (a dApp, tool, game, marketplace, or any innovative project).

Or integrate Solana into your project in a meaningful way.

Whether it’s payments, NFTs, DeFi, or something completely out of the box – as long as you leverage Solana, you’re in the race to win!

🏆 How to Win
The core requirement is using Solana – either by building directly on it or integrating it with your project.

Projects will be judged on creativity, functionality, and execution.

The best Solana-powered projects will take home the prizes and recognition.

Judging Criteria
Did you build a project on Solana?

Did you build a thoughtful onboarding experience?

Did you leverage any features unique to Solana like token extensions, blinks, solana mobile stack, etc.

Did you submit to the Solana global hackathon by Colosseum here : https://www.colosseum.com/cypherpunk what should i build to win

🔥 LFG! You’re in a great spot — 100xSchool Hackathon + Solana Global Hackathon (Colosseum Cypherpunk) means you can win at two levels if you pick the right project.

To maximize your chances of standing out, you’ll want a project that:

Solves a real problem.

Uses Solana-native features (token extensions, Blinks, Solana Mobile, compressed NFTs, Firedancer readiness).

Feels polished with great UX — onboarding is often overlooked but can decide winners.

Here are winning project directions (tailored to Cypherpunk & 100xSchool):

🚀 High-Impact Ideas for 2025 Hackathons
1. On-Chain Identity + Payments with Blinks

Build a “Login with Solana Blink” flow that lets users sign in anywhere with their Solana wallet (similar to OAuth, but native).

Add token-gated payments or subscriptions (using Token Extensions for royalties, transfers with rules, etc.).

Why it stands out: Blinks are hot in Solana right now, but very few people have shipped polished UX around them.

2. DeFi + Real World Assets (RWA) Toolkit

A protocol/tooling kit that helps projects tokenize real-world invoices, subscriptions, or small business payments.

Use token extensions for compliance (transfer restrictions, metadata).

Bonus: integrate with USDC on Solana (fast + cheap).

Why it stands out: RWA is the biggest DeFi narrative of 2025, and Solana’s throughput makes it a natural home.

3. Solana Mobile Game (Saga + dApp Store)

Build a hyper-casual multiplayer game with Solana wallet baked in for in-game assets or microtransactions.

Use compressed NFTs for cheap minting of items.

Why it stands out: Solana Mobile is still underexplored. Judges love demos that run directly on the Saga phone.

4. Decentralized Onboarding Stack

Create a tool that lets anyone onboard to Solana without crypto knowledge.

Features: one-click wallet creation (using Solana Mobile Stack or social recovery), fiat-to-USDC integration, and Blinks for easy sharing.

Why it stands out: User onboarding is one of the judging criteria. If you nail this, you’re ahead of 80% of teams.

5. Privacy-First Social dApp (Cypherpunk Theme)

Think “Farcaster on Solana” with end-to-end encryption, zk proofs for identity, and Solana for scalable message feeds.

Use token-gated communities with compressed NFTs.

Why it stands out: Directly aligns with Cypherpunk hackathon theme (privacy, decentralization, censorship resistance).

✅ Tips to Win:

Make the UX buttery smooth (wallet pop-ups should feel invisible).

Show real users testing it (friends/classmates using your dApp = bonus points).

Submit to both 100xSchool + Colosseum (double chance to win).

In the pitch/demo, emphasize “why Solana” (cheap, fast, scalable, mobile-ready).

👉 My advice:
If you want the highest chance to win globally, build either #1 (On-Chain Identity + Blinks) or #4 (Onboarding Stack). These directly align with Solana’s current priorities (Blinks + UX).

If you want something fun but still competitive, go for #3 (Mobile Game with Saga integration) — judges love demos they can try on their phones.

Do you want me to pick one concrete hackathon project idea (with name, features, and demo plan) that you can start building right away?

Got it — if we’re aiming for maximum chance of winning at both 100xSchool Hackathon and Colosseum Cypherpunk, the strongest bet is:

🌐 BlinkPay – One-Click Payments & Login with Solana Blinks
🔑 Why this is 100% your best shot

Directly aligned with Solana’s priorities → Blinks are Solana’s biggest push in 2025.

Cross-cutting use case → works for DeFi, NFTs, gaming, marketplaces, and social.

Judging criteria covered →

Built 100% on Solana ✅

Polished onboarding (one-click walletless entry, then upgrade to full wallet) ✅

Uses unique Solana tech: Blinks, Token Extensions, Mobile ✅

Easily submit to Cypherpunk + stand out as “privacy + usability” ✅

🚀 Core Features to Build

Blink Login → Replace “Sign in with Google” with “Sign in with Solana Blink.”

Users authenticate via Blink → get a temporary session wallet.

Blink Payments → Send USDC / any SPL token directly via Blink link (e.g., pay@username.sol
 → generates a Blink).

Could be used for subscriptions, tips, or e-commerce checkout.

Walletless Onboarding → New users don’t need Phantom/Solana wallet upfront.

Auto-create lightweight wallet (using Solana Mobile Stack or custodial under hood).

Option to export/upgrade to Phantom/Backpack later.

Developer API → Let other apps integrate “BlinkPay” in 2 lines of code.

🎯 Demo Plan (Hackathon-Ready)

Build a mini SaaS or marketplace demo → e.g., “Buy a coffee for 1 USDC” via BlinkPay.

Show live:

A new user with no wallet buys coffee → Blink auto-creates wallet + processes payment.

A returning user with Phantom pays instantly with one-click Blink checkout.

Add a privacy angle → payments use token extensions for optional transfer restrictions / metadata-free mode.

🏆 Why Judges Will Love It

Tackles the hardest Solana problem right now → onboarding & payments.

Uses cutting-edge tech (Blinks, Token Extensions, Solana Mobile).

Applicable everywhere (every dApp, game, or business can use BlinkPay).

Looks polished and demo-friendly (people can test it live).

✅ This is the closest you’ll get to a guaranteed win idea — solves onboarding, uses Solana-native tech, and has massive adoption potential.

Do you want me to draft a full hackathon blueprint (architecture diagram + tech stack + timeline for 2 weeks) so you can start building BlinkPay immediately?

Perfect 🔥 — let’s lock in BlinkPay and map out your hackathon execution plan so you can deliver something polished, demo-ready, and highly competitive.

🛠️ BlinkPay Hackathon Blueprint
1. 📐 Architecture Overview
[User clicks Blink] 
     ↓
[Blink Resolver Service]  ← built by you
     ↓
[Solana Program / Token Extensions] → USDC/SPL transfer, session wallet handling
     ↓
[Merchant / App Backend] → confirms payment, unlocks service

Key Components

Frontend (React + Next.js)

Payment checkout UI

“Sign in with Blink” button

Walletless onboarding flow

Blink Middleware (Node.js/TypeScript server)

Generates Blinks (payment links & login links)

Handles walletless session creation

API for dApps to request Blinks

On-Chain Program (Rust + Anchor)

Verify payment / login signatures

Manage escrow / token routing if needed

Optional: add token extension rules (e.g., transfer restrictions, memo tags)

Database (Supabase / Postgres)

Store users, sessions, merchant payment requests

2. ⏱️ 2-Week Timeline
🔹 Day 1–2: Setup & MVP

Spin up Solana dev environment (Anchor, Solana CLI, Phantom wallet dev setup).

Basic frontend: landing page + “Buy Coffee” Blink demo.

Write Rust program: accept USDC/SPL token payment.

🔹 Day 3–5: Blink Integration

Implement Blink generation + resolution in backend.

Users click link → wallet/signature prompt (if Phantom installed).

Walletless session (auto-generated keypair + temp storage).

🔹 Day 6–8: Core Features

“Sign in with Blink” (auth signature → JWT in backend).

BlinkPay checkout flow: pay 1 USDC to merchant wallet.

Database: track successful logins + payments.

🔹 Day 9–11: Polishing

Add UX flows:

Walletless onboarding → upgrade to Phantom.

Success/failure payment screens.

Add token extensions for privacy/transfer restrictions.

Mobile-first UI for Solana Mobile demo.

🔹 Day 12–14: Demo Prep

Deploy testnet + simple SaaS demo (e.g., pay for coffee/subscription).

Record demo video (judge-friendly, <3 min).

Prepare GitHub README + hackathon submission.

3. ⚙️ Tech Stack

Frontend → Next.js + TailwindCSS

Backend → Node.js (Express) + Supabase

Blockchain → Rust + Anchor (program), Solana Web3.js SDK

Wallets → Phantom, Backpack, wallet-adapter

Payment Token → USDC on Solana

Extras → Token Extensions, Blinks API, Solana Mobile Stack (optional bonus)

4. 🎯 Demo Use Case (Judges’ Favorite)

“Buy Coffee with BlinkPay” ☕

User without wallet clicks Blink → auto gets session wallet → pays 1 USDC.

Coffee unlocked ✅ (demo shows instant Solana tx).

“Sign in with Blink” 🔑

New user logs in → profile created with Blink auth.

Return user signs in instantly (no seed phrase, no friction).

5. 🏆 Pitch Script (3 Minutes)

Problem: Web3 onboarding sucks — wallets, seed phrases, friction.

Solution: BlinkPay → one-click login & payments using Solana Blinks.

Demo: Buy coffee + log in live with no wallet.

Tech: Solana program + Blinks + Token Extensions + Solana Mobile.

Impact: Every Solana app, game, and marketplace can integrate BlinkPay with 2 lines of code.

⚡ This blueprint gives you a working MVP + killer demo in 2 weeks. If executed smoothly, you’ll stand out in both 100xSchool and Cypherpunk hackathons.

Do you want me to design the Solana smart contract (Rust + Anchor) for handling BlinkPay payments (so you can start coding the on-chain part immediately)?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 9s
BlinkPay — Anchor / Rust smart contract (design + full on-chain code)

Nice — below is a complete, ready-to-build Anchor program that implements the on-chain payment primitive BlinkPay needs: merchants can create payment requests (optionally), payers call pay (signed by payer) which performs an SPL token transfer (e.g., USDC) from payer → merchant and records a PaymentReceipt PDA. The program emits an event so UIs / indexers (or Blinks) can watch for confirmations.

I include:

full Anchor program (Rust) you can drop into a workspace

explanation of PDAs & seeds

CPI (token program) transfer implementation

events, errors, and security notes

short TypeScript example showing how a frontend / Blink link would assemble the pay transaction

Design summary

Program ID: blink_pay (set in Anchor.toml / replace with your deployed id)

Accounts

Merchant (PDA) — optional merchant registration metadata (merchant pubkey as owner)

PaymentRequest (PDA) — optional request with amount, mint, expiry

PaymentReceipt (PDA) — created on successful payment; immutable record on chain

Instruction surface

initialize_merchant — register merchant metadata (optional)

create_request — merchant creates a payment request (optional convenience)

pay — payer pays a PaymentRequest or directly pays a merchant: does SPL transfer and creates PaymentReceipt

refund — admin or merchant can refund (optional)

How pay works:

Payer signs transaction calling program::pay

Program performs CPI token::transfer from payer_token_account → merchant_token_account (payer's signature required)

Program creates PaymentReceipt PDA that records the payment (payer, merchant, mint, amount, timestamp)

Program emits PaymentCompleted event with receipt PDA and details

Security considerations covered in code comments:

verify token accounts & mints match

check expiry if paying a PaymentRequest

use seeds to derive PDAs correctly

require payer to sign (ensures transfer authority)

prevent replay by using unique request_id and checking PDA not exists

Full Anchor program (Rust)

Create new Anchor program and replace lib.rs with the below. Adjust program ID in Cargo.toml / Anchor.toml as you deploy.

// programs/blink_pay/src/lib.rs
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
use anchor_spl::token::{self, Token, TokenAccount, Transfer};
use anchor_spl::token::ID as TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID;

declare_id!("BLiNkPay11111111111111111111111111111111111"); // replace with your program id after deploy

        Ok(())
    }

    /// Merchant creates an optional payment request (like "invoice").
    /// request_id can be any string (like "coffee-20250924-001"). It's used as PDA seed.

Integration notes & how Blinks / frontend should use pay

A Blink can (and should) wrap a pre-populated transaction or instruction that calls the pay instruction above. Typical flow:

Merchant / backend creates a PaymentRequest (off-chain) and constructs a Blink deep link that references your dApp and includes:

Program ID

Instruction pay parameters: receipt_id, expected_amount, request PDA (if applicable)

Accounts required: payer_ata (left blank for client to fill), merchant_ata, merchant PDA, mint

Optionally a prebuilt serialized transaction that the wallet will sign

User clicks Blink in their mobile / wallet:

Wallet decodes the Blink and opens the relevant wallet app (Phantom / Backpack / mobile wallet)

Wallet populates payer_ata automatically (associated token account for selected SPL mint)

Wallet asks user to sign the transaction

The signed transaction calls the pay instruction on-chain; the CPI transfer executes and PaymentReceipt PDA is created

Frontend observes PaymentCompleted event (via RPC logs / indexer / explorer) to confirm.

Minimal TypeScript/Anchor client example (how to call pay from frontend)

This uses Anchor's program.rpc (you can also build a raw TransactionInstruction and sign it).

// assume `program` is an Anchor Program instance, provider is set
import { web3, BN } from "@project-serum/anchor";
import { TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID, getAssociatedTokenAddress } from "@solana/spl-token";

async function pay(
  connection,

  );
}


Note: For Blink deep links, you'd serialize the same instruction data & account metas and let the wallet populate payerAta/payer signer at runtime. Wallet SDKs (Phantom / Backpack) support deeplinking with serialized transactions or message requests — the exact method depends on wallet.

Deployment & testing tips

Test on devnet / localnet first: Use local validator or devnet with USDC test tokens.

Unit tests: write Anchor tests that:

initialize merchant

create request

simulate payer with token balance, call pay, assert token balances changed and receipt exists

Edge cases to test:

paying wrong amount (should fail)

expired request (should fail)

payer has no ATA (frontend should create ATA or wallet will auto create)

double receipt_id (PDA exists) (should fail on init)

Gas / compute: CPI to token program is cheap; PDAs creation costs lamports. Consider letting merchant create requests off-chain to avoid create-on-pay storage costs, or use ephemeral receipts (or compress receipts off-chain if you want lower storage usage).

Indexing: emit events (done in code). For search & UI, run a small indexer or use a 3rd-party.

Extra features you may want to add (post-MVP)

Compressed receipts via off-chain logging + signature verification (to save on-chain storage)

Escrow + timelock to support dispute/refunds

Permit-style approvals (EIP-2612 equivalent) to allow gasless payments — would require off-chain signed approvals then program verified signature

Meta-transactions: allow a relayer to submit the transaction on behalf of payer (requires more advanced signature handling)

Receipt NFTs: mint an NFT receipt to payer after payment (use compressed NFTs to save cost)

Final notes (UX + Blink integration highlights)

For the best UX (and to win), your Blink should:

prefill the amount, mint, merchant_ata and receipt_id

allow walletless flows by offering fallback (create temporary keypair in backend) — but keep security tradeoffs clear

show clear success state (listen for PaymentCompleted event)

In the hackathon demo, live demo of:

a user with no wallet paying via Blink (mobile link) and receiving service instantly

a user with Phantom paying instantly with one click

show event log / receipt on-chain

If you want, I can now:

generate the Anchor test suite (JS/TS) that runs through init -> create_request -> pay -> asserts balances (recommended)

produce the frontend React/Next checkout component that builds the Blink link and demo UI

or compress this smart contract into a minimal version that stores fewer on-chain bytes if you want to save rent

Which of those do you want next?

BlinkPay – One-Click Payments & Login with Solana Blinks
🔑 Why this is 100% your best shot

Directly aligned with Solana’s priorities → Blinks are Solana’s biggest push in 2025.

Cross-cutting use case → works for DeFi, NFTs, gaming, marketplaces, and social.

Judging criteria covered →

Built 100% on Solana ✅

Polished onboarding (one-click walletless entry, then upgrade to full wallet) ✅

Uses unique Solana tech: Blinks, Token Extensions, Mobile ✅

Easily submit to Cypherpunk + stand out as “privacy + usability” ✅

🚀 Core Features to Build

Blink Login → Replace “Sign in with Google” with “Sign in with Solana Blink.”

Users authenticate via Blink → get a temporary session wallet.

Blink Payments → Send USDC / any SPL token directly via Blink link (e.g., pay@username.sol
 → generates a Blink).

Could be used for subscriptions, tips, or e-commerce checkout.

Walletless Onboarding → New users don’t need Phantom/Solana wallet upfront.

Auto-create lightweight wallet (using Solana Mobile Stack or custodial under hood).

Option to export/upgrade to Phantom/Backpack later.

Developer API → Let other apps integrate “BlinkPay” in 2 lines of code.

🎯 Demo Plan (Hackathon-Ready)

Build a mini SaaS or marketplace demo → e.g., “Buy a coffee for 1 USDC” via BlinkPay.

Show live:

A new user with no wallet buys coffee → Blink auto-creates wallet + processes payment.

A returning user with Phantom pays instantly with one-click Blink checkout.

Add a privacy angle → payments use token extensions for optional transfer restrictions / metadata-free mode.

🏆 Why Judges Will Love It

Tackles the hardest Solana problem right now → onboarding & payments.

Uses cutting-edge tech (Blinks, Token Extensions, Solana Mobile).

Applicable everywhere (every dApp, game, or business can use BlinkPay).

Thought for 9s
BlinkPay — Anchor / Rust smart contract (design + full on-chain code)

Nice — below is a complete, ready-to-build Anchor program that implements the on-chain payment primitive BlinkPay needs: merchants can create payment requests (optionally), payers call pay (signed by payer) which performs an SPL token transfer (e.g., USDC) from payer → merchant and records a PaymentReceipt PDA. The program emits an event so UIs / indexers (or Blinks) can watch for confirmations.

I include:

full Anchor program (Rust) you can drop into a workspace

explanation of PDAs & seeds

CPI (token program) transfer implementation

events, errors, and security notes

short TypeScript example showing how a frontend / Blink link would assemble the pay transaction

Design summary

Program ID: blink_pay (set in Anchor.toml / replace with your deployed id)

Accounts

Merchant (PDA) — optional merchant registration metadata (merchant pubkey as owner)

PaymentRequest (PDA) — optional request with amount, mint, expiry

PaymentReceipt (PDA) — created on successful payment; immutable record on chain

Instruction surface

initialize_merchant — register merchant metadata (optional)

create_request — merchant creates a payment request (optional convenience)

pay — payer pays a PaymentRequest or directly pays a merchant: does SPL transfer and creates PaymentReceipt

refund — admin or merchant can refund (optional)

How pay works:

Payer signs transaction calling program::pay

Program performs CPI token::transfer from payer_token_account → merchant_token_account (payer's signature required)

Program creates PaymentReceipt PDA that records the payment (payer, merchant, mint, amount, timestamp)

Program emits PaymentCompleted event with receipt PDA and details

Security considerations covered in code comments:

verify token accounts & mints match

check expiry if paying a PaymentRequest

use seeds to derive PDAs correctly

require payer to sign (ensures transfer authority)

prevent replay by using unique request_id and checking PDA not exists

Full Anchor program (Rust)

Create new Anchor program and replace lib.rs with the below. Adjust program ID in Cargo.toml / Anchor.toml as you deploy.

// programs/blink_pay/src/lib.rs
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
use anchor_spl::token::{self, Token, TokenAccount, Transfer};
use anchor_spl::token::ID as TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID;

declare_id!("BLiNkPay11111111111111111111111111111111111"); // replace with your program id after deploy

Integration notes & how Blinks / frontend should use pay

A Blink can (and should) wrap a pre-populated transaction or instruction that calls the pay instruction above. Typical flow:

Merchant / backend creates a PaymentRequest (off-chain) and constructs a Blink deep link that references your dApp and includes:

Program ID

Instruction pay parameters: receipt_id, expected_amount, request PDA (if applicable)

Accounts required: payer_ata (left blank for client to fill), merchant_ata, merchant PDA, mint

Optionally a prebuilt serialized transaction that the wallet will sign

User clicks Blink in their mobile / wallet:

Wallet decodes the Blink and opens the relevant wallet app (Phantom / Backpack / mobile wallet)

Wallet populates payer_ata automatically (associated token account for selected SPL mint)

Wallet asks user to sign the transaction

The signed transaction calls the pay instruction on-chain; the CPI transfer executes and PaymentReceipt PDA is created

Frontend observes PaymentCompleted event (via RPC logs / indexer / explorer) to confirm.

Minimal TypeScript/Anchor client example (how to call pay from frontend)

This uses Anchor's program.rpc (you can also build a raw TransactionInstruction and sign it).

// assume program is an Anchor Program instance, provider is set
import { web3, BN } from "@project-serum/anchor";
import { TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID, getAssociatedTokenAddress } from "@solana/spl-token";

async function pay(

Note: For Blink deep links, you'd serialize the same instruction data & account metas and let the wallet populate payerAta/payer signer at runtime. Wallet SDKs (Phantom / Backpack) support deeplinking with serialized transactions or message requests — the exact method depends on wallet.

Deployment & testing tips

Test on devnet / localnet first: Use local validator or devnet with USDC test tokens.

Unit tests: write Anchor tests that:

initialize merchant

create request

simulate payer with token balance, call pay, assert token balances changed and receipt exists

Edge cases to test:

paying wrong amount (should fail)

expired request (should fail)

payer has no ATA (frontend should create ATA or wallet will auto create)

double receipt_id (PDA exists) (should fail on init)

Gas / compute: CPI to token program is cheap; PDAs creation costs lamports. Consider letting merchant create requests off-chain to avoid create-on-pay storage costs, or use ephemeral receipts (or compress receipts off-chain if you want lower storage usage).

Indexing: emit events (done in code). For search & UI, run a small indexer or use a 3rd-party.

Extra features you may want to add (post-MVP)

Compressed receipts via off-chain logging + signature verification (to save on-chain storage)

Escrow + timelock to support dispute/refunds

Permit-style approvals (EIP-2612 equivalent) to allow gasless payments — would require off-chain signed approvals then program verified signature

Meta-transactions: allow a relayer to submit the transaction on behalf of payer (requires more advanced signature handling)

Receipt NFTs: mint an NFT receipt to payer after payment (use compressed NFTs to save cost)

Final notes (UX + Blink integration highlights)

For the best UX (and to win), your Blink should:

prefill the amount, mint, merchant_ata and receipt_id

allow walletless flows by offering fallback (create temporary keypair in backend) — but keep security tradeoffs clear

show clear success state (listen for PaymentCompleted event)

In the hackathon demo, live demo of:

a user with no wallet paying via Blink (mobile link) and receiving service instantly

a user with Phantom paying instantly with one click

show event log / receipt on-chain

If you want, I can now:

generate the Anchor test suite (JS/TS) that runs through init -> create_request -> pay -> asserts balances (recommended)

produce the frontend React/Next checkout component that builds the Blink link and demo UI

Best Architectures for Solana Blink-Based dApps

BlinkPay: Solana One-Click Login & Payments Architecture

BlinkPay solves crypto’s onboarding and checkout friction by letting users log in or pay with a single Solana blink (shareable action link). In practice, a user in a cafe simply taps a Blink link (or scans a QR) to authenticate or pay 1 USDC for coffee without pre-installing any wallet. Under the hood, BlinkPay runs a React/Next.js frontend and a Node.js “Blink middleware” that generates Solana Action URLs and temporary session wallets. When the user clicks a Blink, their wallet (Phantom/Backpack/Mobile) automatically prepares a Solana transaction which is signed and sent on-chain. Because blinks are “shareable, metadata-rich links” for on-chain transactions
solana.com
solana.com
, BlinkPay can trigger token transfers or login signatures directly within the user’s existing apps (browser, Discord, etc.) without a traditional dApp interface.

Core Components & Flow

Frontend (Next.js + Tailwind): Hosts the BlinkPay UI (e.g. “Buy Coffee for 1 USDC”). Includes “Sign in with Blink” and checkout buttons. After a click, it either opens a wallet popup (if user has Phantom) or calls our backend to create a session keypair. The UI shows success/failure based on on-chain events.

Blink Middleware (Node.js/Express): Generates blinks (deep links) and session wallets. For a payment, it creates a Solana Action with pre-filled parameters (amount, mint, merchant PDA, etc.) and returns a URL/QR. For login, it crafts an authentication message. BlinkPay’s backend also uses Supabase (hosted Postgres) for session persistence. Supabase auto-generates a secure REST API on top of the database schema
supabase.com
, letting us store merchants, sessions, requests and receipts with little custom code.

On-Chain Program (Rust + Anchor): Handles merchant registration, payment requests (invoices), and actual payments. We use Anchor for safety and brevity: accounts are defined with #[derive(Accounts)] and PDAs derived with seeds (e.g. ["merchant", merchant_pubkey]). The key instruction is pay: it verifies the payer’s token account and does an SPL token transfer via CPI (Anchor’s token::transfer). On success, it creates an immutable PaymentReceipt PDA recording the details and emits a PaymentCompleted event. Anchor’s PDA and event mechanisms ensure security (signer checks, expiration checks) and let frontends/indexers easily watch for payments.

Optional: We leverage Solana’s Token Extensions for privacy (e.g. transfer restrictions, off-chain metadata) when generating token accounts. For mobile users, we integrate the Solana Mobile Stack so the Blink can open directly in a smartphone wallet with minimal UX friction.

On-Chain Program Design

Merchant PDA: Each merchant (or app) initializes a Merchant account PDA using their authority public key (seeded by "merchant" + key). This stores optional metadata (display name, etc.).

PaymentRequest (Invoice): A merchant can pre-create a PaymentRequest PDA (seeded by "request" + merchant + request_id) containing the amount, mint, and optional expiry. This is optional but allows off-chain IDs for invoices.

Pay Instruction: When a user pays, they call the program’s pay method (signed by the payer). The program checks: the PDA (if provided) matches the merchant and mint, the request isn’t expired, and the amounts match expectations. It then does a CPI to the SPL Token program to move tokens (transfer) from payer_ata to merchant_ata. All accounts/mints are validated by Anchor’s macros for safety.

Receipt PDA & Event: On success, the program creates a PaymentReceipt PDA (seeded by "receipt" + payer + receipt_id) that logs merchant, payer, amount, mint, timestamp, etc. It then emits a PaymentCompleted event. This event allows the BlinkPay backend or any indexer to detect when a payment arrives and unlock the merchant’s service instantly.

This design separates payment logic: the on-chain program never holds funds in escrow – it simply moves tokens directly between wallets under program control, and records the result. Using Anchor’s PDA and event system ensures each payment is unique, authenticated, and easily tracked. (In summary, “Blinks” let any website trigger these on-chain transfers via URLs
solana.com
, and Anchor makes those transfers safe and auditable.)

Tech Stack & Timeline

Frontend: Next.js + TailwindCSS for fast web UI; @solana/wallet-adapter for wallet support (Phantom, Backpack, etc.).

Backend: Node.js + Express (or similar) for Blink link generation and server APIs. Connects to Supabase/Postgres for data storage. Supabase’s auto-REST API lets us treat the DB like a service
supabase.com
.

Blockchain: Rust + Anchor for the smart contract. Use anchor_spl::token::transfer for SPL transfers, and define PDAs with seeds for merchants/requests/receipts. Deploy on devnet/testnet initially with USDC mint for demo.

Wallets: Phantom/Backpack browser wallets, plus optional Solana Mobile Stack for iOS/Android walletless flows.

Timeline (2 weeks):

Day 1–3: Project setup. Scaffold frontend (landing + dummy buy button) and Anchor program (project initialized, ID set). Write simple pay instruction that does an SPL transfer (hardcode one receiver for MVP).

Day 4–6: Integrate Blink generation. Backend creates Action payloads (JSON/transaction) and returns a blink URL or QR. Frontend “Buy” button uses this link (via window.open or WalletAdapter deep link). Implement basic login flow: user signs an auth message with Phantom (no password).

Day 7–10: Flesh out features. Enable backend to auto-create a lightweight session wallet for walletless users (e.g. using Solana Mobile Stack key storage). Connect Supabase to store merchants and sessions. Wire the real Anchor program: use PDA for merchant, request, receipt as described. Ensure the pay instruction creates a PaymentReceipt on-chain.

Day 11–13: Polish UI/UX. Show clear success/fail messages. Add “Upgrade to Phantom” flow if user wants to keep their wallet. Implement token-extension rules if needed (e.g. mark USDC as private for demo). Optimize on mobile (maybe responsive design, Dialect SDK for link generation). Test end-to-end on devnet.

Day 14: Demo prep. Deploy contracts on devnet, seed USDC in some wallets, and build a simple demo page (e.g. coffee shop or newsletter sign-up). Prepare a short recorded video and a README with instructions.

Each technology is well-supported: Anchor for programs (handles serialization & security), Supabase for quick DB, and Solana’s new Blinks spec for seamless links
solana.com
. This stack lets you integrate BlinkPay by “copy-pasting” a JS SDK or REST call: for example, a merchant could call await blinkpay.createPayment({amount:1000000, mint:USDC, merchant:myKey}) and get back a one-click URL.

Demo Use-Cases

Buy Coffee (Coffee Shop Demo): A user (no wallet) clicks “Buy Coffee for 1 USDC” on mobile. BlinkPay backend generates a session keypair and a Blink with pay action. Their mobile wallet opens with the TX pre-filled, they sign, and 1 USDC transfers to the merchant. The site immediately sees the on-chain PaymentCompleted event and shows “Coffee unlocked – enjoy!” in < 10 seconds.

Returning User (Instant Pay): A user with Phantom visits the site. They click “Buy Coffee” and Phantom opens instantly (via the Blink link or Wallet Adapter) with a 1-click prompt. The user confirms, and the payment goes through in one click – no seed phrases or account setup needed.

“Sign in with Blink”: A new user without any crypto goes to a dApp and clicks “Sign in with Solana”. BlinkPay generates an auth challenge (signed message) and a temporary account. The user signs it in their wallet, BlinkPay backend verifies the signature, and creates a user session (with an associated Solana account). They now have a Solana identity (public key) without ever handling mnemonics.

These demos highlight BlinkPay’s value: universal usability and privacy. Blinks work anywhere users already are (chat, email, websites)
solana.com
, and because actions return minimally tagged transactions, we avoid leaky metadata – privacy-minded merchants can even restrict transfers by extension rules so funds can only go to known service accounts.

Security & Best Practices

Signature-Based Auth: Every action (login or pay) requires a wallet signature. There’s no secret sharing – the user’s wallet signs either a login message or a token transfer instruction.

PDA Seeds & Ownership: We use deterministic seeds (e.g. "merchant", merchant_key) to ensure only the true merchant authority can create or manage their PDAs. Anchor’s has_one and init constraints enforce correct owners.

Amount/Mint Checks: The program double-checks that the payer’s ATA and the merchant’s ATA have the expected mint (USDC) and that the amount hasn’t been tampered with. Any mismatch causes the transaction to abort.

Nonce/Receipt Uniqueness: Each payment link includes a unique receipt_id (like a timestamp or UUID), used as a PDA seed. This prevents replay: once a PaymentReceipt PDA exists for that ID, the same link cannot be reused.

Event Monitoring: The PaymentCompleted event (and the on-chain PaymentReceipt itself) serve as immutable proof of payment. The frontend/backend simply watches for this to confirm a payment, eliminating trust issues about “did funds arrive?”.

In summary, BlinkPay delivers on Solana’s vision of seamless web3 UX. By leveraging Solana Actions (Blinks), it turns every payment or login into a simple link or button
solana.com
. The architecture combines a modern web stack (Next.js, Node, Supabase) with a cutting-edge Anchor program to handle tokens. Every element – from the one-click mobile payments to the walletless session creation – is designed for demo polish and real-world impact. Judges will appreciate that it tackles Solana’s hardest problems (onboarding & payments) with native tech (blinks, token extensions) and a clear roadmap, while the integrated architecture ensures you can go from idea to working product in a two-week sprint.
